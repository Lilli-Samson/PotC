You stare at the stranger who just entered the tavern and panic. You can't have him call the guards on you. Running away until you eventually get cut down is not an option. You could probably take him out, but then what? Time slows down around you, freezing both him and yourself in place. You close your eyes trying to think clearly and have to wait for your sluggish eye lids to obey you. The brief moment of quiet time gives you some comfort. You know this man is not a guard, at least not on duty since he doesn't wear armor and isn't visibly armed either. And this *is* a tavern after all, strangers entering is to be expected. Then again you wouldn't enter a tavern with 'Who are you'. Your best bet is to act naturally, you're not the intruder, he is. You're the waitress here, you're supposed to be here. And even if everything goes wrong you can still run away or fight your way out later.

Time resumes normally, your eyes flutter open and you force a smile on your lips. "Hi! I'm Alice. I'm new here, Maira and Olin should be with us shortly." You get up and make a wide gesture towards all the tables. "Pick a seat. We have beer, wine and food. I'm not sure what exactly, but I'll ask. Can I get you something already?" He closes the door, walks over to a table and sits down, eyeing you up and down before finally saying "Ale, as always." You try not to let your relief over having defused the situation show on your face. "Uh ... right away, Mister".

You go behind the bar and wonder what exactly to do. There are various bottles, mugs and barrels, but which one has ale in it, if any, is a mystery to you. You start by putting a mug on the counter, fairly sure that you'll be needing that and then your heightened senses pick up movement on the stairs. "Olin!" You rush over to him and get close in a whisper. "Someone came and ordered ale. I don't know what to do ... It's not on the menu." That last part came out sounding more like an accusation than intended. He looks at you with his dumb expression and then just walks past you behind the bar. "Hello Cenric" Olin says before filling a mug with what must be ale from one of the barrels and puts it on the counter, momentarily confused why there is another mug already before putting it back.

Olin looks at you expectantly for a few seconds before you snap out of it and walk over to the counter to take the ale and bring it to Cenric. You put the mug down in front of him and give him an awkward smile. "Here you go." He takes a big sip before putting it back down, then looks you over again, seemingly stripping you with his eyes. "How about you sit down and keep me company?" He goes for another sip but freezes when he hears your answer. "Uhm ... I suppose I can. Until more guests come at least." He gives you a look like he is wondering if you're serious and Olin seems to glare at you from behind the counter making you think you did something wrong, but then Cenric points to the seat next to him with a grin. "You're a nice girl, huh? Sit."

You sit as told, more aware now of your naked bottom under the dress. Thankfully it's long enough to go over your knees; you won't be flashing anyone by accident, but it still feels like insufficient clothing to be sitting here. You take a closer look at the man now that you're not so focused on armor and weapons. He looks around 40 years old with pale skin, his receding hairline making him look older than he probably is. He seems clean enough, wearing a buttoned shirt over his visible belly and pants, unlike Olin without suspenders. Not wanting to have to answer questions about yourself you decide to be proactive. "So ... you're here often? You're our first guest today. What do you do for a living?" His demeanor becomes even more friendly, apparently happy to talk about himself. "I work in the treasury. Accounting. I make sure nobody gets left out when taxes are due. It makes me real popular!" He laughs at his joke and you manage to at least smile. Then he leans in conspiratorially, lowering his voice, but you're pretty sure even Olin heard him. "There was a break-in last night. Someone tried to rob the treasury. Can you imagine?" You force your eyes to go wide mimicking shock. "Wow. Does that happen often? Did they catch him?"

"It's very rare. Usually it's one of the guards or accountants trying to swipe something, but this was some really desperate guy just going in the front door from what I heard. Really stupid. Of course the guards got him. But ..." he takes a sip for emphasis "not before he took out Captain Lavrov. A good man really, he made sure none of his underlings abused their position. I wonder who'll get promoted to replace him. I hope someone decent." You bite your lips, trying to get images of being cornered in the cellar and essentially executed out of your head. "That's horrible." You look down, not knowing what to say. "Yeah, it's a real shame. Got stabbed in the back when he wasn't looking. To Lavrov!" You suppress the need to correct him while he drinks, gulp after gulp until his ale is empty and slams the mug on the table. You're glad you don't have your own drink to join in the toast for a man you killed. "You want another one?" you ask, pointing at his mug. "Only if you keep me company." He grins at you again and you take his mug, unsure if it's normal for guests to be this forward, but you don't have anything better to do for now.

Once back at the bar Olin wordlessly takes the mug and starts pouring new ale into it. Maira comes from the kitchen that starts smelling really good and you wonder if you'll get some of whatever she is cooking. "So, who keeps tabs on the orders? Like ... do I have to remember everything that was ordered and who ordered it?" Maira shakes her head. "Olin remembers. You just have to tell him what you get for who and know where to bring it. Hello Cenric" she says with an unamused expression when she spots the guest. "Hello Maira. Don't worry, I'm not here on official business. Yet." She gives him a death glare. Olin puts the mug in front of you and Maira turns to you. "Get going honey, the mugs don't carry themselves. You can't be lazy if you want to keep up once we're starting to fill up." You look down and quickly move on your bare feet to Cenric, giving him his drink. Maira has returned to her kitchen and since you have a new friend you decide to probe him for information. "What was that about? Are you here to collect taxes?" He shakes his head. "Nah, I just write down amounts paid and owed, I don't collect. But I do know Maira is behind on her taxes. If she delays it any longer she'll get in trouble with the guards." You look over to Olin who starts wiping the counter and you feel he is angry but can't tell if it's about the taxes, Cenric or something else.

There is some awkward silence where you fail to think of something to say until Cenric moves closer. You can smell the ale on him when he puts a hand on your knee. "So. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?" You squirm uncomfortably on your seat, wondering if you should not be letting him have so much alcohol at the start of the evening. Pushing his hand away would be rather rude, so you stand it for now. "I ... uh ... no. I don't really know anyone here besides Maira and Olin." He grins at you like he just won the lottery. "You know, we could go somewhere and I'll be your boyfriend for a while?" You see Olin's head peak up, possibly willing to smack Cenric for you if he goes too far but doesn't get involved on his own. Cenric leans in, his hand trying to shuffle your dress up and you're wondering if he will try to kiss and fondle you right here with Olin watching.

"And what do we have here?" you hear a voice from behind, belonging to a man who just entered the tavern. Cenric groans and retreats his hand, grabbing the mug instead and you take the opportunity to get up and greet the new guests. "Welcome! I'm Alice. Have a seat." The man gives you a big confident smile. He seems a little younger, in his thirties, but his hair is styled well and his clothes are much more elegant than anything you've seen here before. He is flanked by two young women and puts an arm around each one. The women each wear fancy, colorful and short dresses that show off their big breasts and quite a bit of leg. They are wearing heals, making them a little taller than him and you feel reminded of pictures of an old Playboy owner with models in his arm. One of the women is brunette and one a blonde, both rather pretty and eyeing you like sharks.

"Cenric, I didn't know you had it in you! Talking to a girl without getting her drunk and you didn't even get slapped! Yet. Good for you. But don't worry, I'll be taking over now." He plops down on a bench while Cenric pretends not to hear anything. The women giggle and sit on either side of the new guest as you approach cautiously. "What can I bring you?" He looks you up and down, undressing you with his eyes like every man so far today who didn't see you naked, but his look is different, more judging than lusty. "Why are you in such a hurry? You need to enjoy life or it ends too quickly." You stand there awkwardly while he laughs, unsure what to do. "My name is Edwin Boltone, you might have heard of be. I own quite a few establishments here. What about you?" You look at him with a raised eyebrow, remembering Maira's warning of him being some sort of scoundrel and can't help giving him a little sass. "I'm Alice and I don't even own the dress I'm wearing, never mind establishments." He laughs again, apparently not bothered by your tone. "A feisty one! I like that. I'll be having wine, three glasses, no, make that four. And some of that goodness that Maira is preparing." You nod and turn to the bar, but seeing Olin already pulling out a bottle of wine you just pass by him and go straight to the kitchen.

It feels like everyone will try to take advantage of you here and you'll have to be careful how you behave around everyone. Once in the kitchen you see Maira stirring a pot hanging over the fire, making some sort of stew. "Edwin Boltone ordered food" you say, then realize you are not sure if he ordered just for himself or his lady friends as well, but Maira sends you right back without even looking up from the pot. "Tell him I'll be with him in a moment." Back at the bar you find a tray with four glasses of wine and you carefully put your hand under it to balance it while you walk over to Edwin, not wanting to drop and smash the wine glasses on the floor on your first order that requires some skill. You place one glass in front of the blonde, one in front of the brunette and see Edwin squinting his eyes but not say anything. Finally he gets his glass and you place the last glass in front of the empty chair opposite of Edwin, unsure if it is meant for you.

"Maira will be here soon. Enjoy your wine." You turn to leave, but he stops you with a gesture. "Sit for a moment, there is nobody else to service." You look over to Cenric who has his head in his hands, looking away from Edwin's table and apparently hasn't finished his mug yet either. You sit down, still unsure if the wine is for you. He takes his glass in hand, swirls it around and smells it, but then puts it back without tasting the wine. "Tell me, how much do you make here?" You look at him awkwardly, Maira's words about elves not getting payment ringing in your ears, but you can't tell him that. "I ... uh ... I just started" you dodge the question, but he just nods understandingly. "I see. Well, if you're not too busy, maybe I can offer you ..." he stops mid sentence and looks past you, seeing Maira come with a bowl of stew. "Excuse me, business." You get up as Maira puts the food in front of Edwin, then she waves you away.

You consider going back to Cenric, but new guests arrive and you rush over to greet them and show them to empty tables. Soon the tavern fills with guests, the talk of horses running through the city and yelling in the night. Being untrained in waiting tables you try your best to keep up, collecting orders and delivering drinks. The smell from the kitchen makes quite a few guests ask for food and you questioningly look towards Maira, but she is still talking to Edwin who seems to be having a great time. He sees your look and gives you a wink, but you get distracted by more people demanding you get them what they ordered and it's getting quite loud and hectic. Thankfully Olin seems to always have the correct drinks ready and is able to point you to the tables that ordered them whenever you get confused.

As the evening progresses people seem to get increasingly drunk and loud, Maira had retreated to her kitchen and you're now also carrying bowels with stew around for anyone who orders food. Some of the guests get increasingly handsy, first giving you a light pad on the butt when you put down the drinks, but Cenric, having been drinking for longer than the rest and quite drunk by now has to do one better. As you bend over next to him to put down drinks for him and what must be his friends at his table you feel his hand sliding up your leg from behind, going up your inner thigh and raising your dress in the process. It feels electrifying to be touched like that, but you don't want all of the tavern to see your naked bottom, exhibitionist or not. You gasp and just as he gets dangerously close to your privates time slows down again, giving you time to turn and push the contents of his mug right in his face at incredible speed.

His grin is replaced with a shocked and then hurt expression while the rest of the tavern bellows out laughs, clearly amused at his misfortune. After recovering from the shock, still dripping ale from his face he gets up and turns to the exit, slamming the door on his way out causing even more laughter. Seeing that your patience and goodhearted nature is limited the other guests mostly keep their hands to themselves now, only lightly brushing against your leg or butt with plausible deniability that it was an accident, avoiding any straight-up groping.  
As the light coming through the windows diminishes people start to pay and leave. You remember back at the very start the first guard yelling about a curfew. Once a few guests leave the rest are soon to follow, leaving only Edwin with his two companions and few other stragglers behind. He seems to be in a great mood after quite some wine and there definitely was inappropriate touching with his girls involved, but they don't seem to mind at all. Now that you have less to do as everyone is just finishing their drinks and standing in a line in front of Olin to pay, Edwin waves you over to him.

While you're on your way he whispers something in the brunette's ear and you see her wiggle out of her seat and disappear under the table. "Come, sit!" You sit as told and give him a tired smile. Your feet are hurting from walking around barefoot for hours, but overall you're holding up quite well. "I still want to talk to you. We were interrupted earlier" Edwin begins. "Do you want to know what I do for a living?" He doesn't wait for an answer. "I run establishments. One of them is a joy house not that far away from here. Now, you ..." you eye the wine glass in front of him, making him pause and choose his words carefully, not wanting to end up like Cenric. "You are welcome to drop by some time. Just to see what it's like. We provide all sorts of services, some of which you might enjoy yourself. I understand that you may think you're not that kind of girl, but ..." he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a gold coin. "See this? That's the standard rate for a night. Now, of course you're not standard, you're special ..." He pauses, gauging your reaction and evaluate the blank look on your face. "You don't need to answer right now, but I do ask you to visit some time. I promise you'll be perfectly safe, as are all my employees." He plays with the gold coin and you bite your lip, not out of greed for money but because you used to have a hundred of those and now they are gone.

"I ... think you should leave." You're about to get up when he rolls the coin towards you and it drops down under the table. It was clearly on purpose and your face shows annoyance before going down on your knees to pick up the coin, ignoring that you're showing him some cleavage as it's less than what his companions have been showing him the whole evening. Once your head is under the table your jaw drops as you can see that the brunette is kneeling in front of Edwin under the table, her head bopping up and down on his cock. She must have been at it since she went under, raising her head up and only licking the tip as his cock twitches fully hard, leaking some precum. You quickly spot the coin and grab it, only to see him push her head back down, all the way into his crotch. You can see the girl jerk a few times, but his hands hold her head without her able to move or complain. A moment later he releases her and you hear a gasp for air, followed by coughing. You decide it's definitely time for you to finally get back up from under the table and sit back on the seat, coin in hand, face flushed.

He grins at you. "I can tell you're interested. Come by some time and we'll talk. Keep the coin. It's just a fraction of what you could be making every day if you were so inclined." The brunette has risen from under the table and sits next to you, her face flushes as well and fidgeting with her mouth making sure there are no leftovers dripping down anywhere. "I'll think about it" you say and pocket the coin, your only coin, and Edwin smiles like he knows he won, gets up and leads his girls out. You half expected his dick to be hanging out, but the brunette seems to have tugged it back and closed up while you were talking. You realize you never got to know the women's names.

Once the last guests left it's almost completely dark outside and you hear guards yelling at people to get moving or pay a fine for breaking the curfew. Olin is wiping tables and you join him, putting the last mugs on the counter and help wipe the rest of the tables. "That was ... something" you say to Olin who doesn't respond. "So ... how much is ale?" You try to strike up a conversation. "Ale is beer. Beer is 4 silver." He never looks at you and you feel like he is angry at you but unwilling to talk about it. Maira appears behind you, counting stacks of coins behind the counter and nods approvingly. "Today was a good day. We've earned ourselves some leftovers." She puts three bowels with stew on the table and you eat together, feeling almost like a family.

Since Olin doesn't want to talk you ask Maira. "What's with the curfew?" She looks up from her bowel and takes another bite before answering. "You're really not from around here, are you?" You just shake your head. "The curfew is from sundown until sunrise. Nobody is allowed outside at night. You will only find guards and criminals anyway, everything is closed. Sometimes we need to make sure our guests leave early enough to not get in trouble even if they don't want to go." You nod, but then have an idea. "Couldn't you rent out rooms so people can stay the night?" She looks at you like you suggested eating children. "And have them stay in my bed? In your bed? Or you want to just stay in Edwin's bed?" Now it's your turn to stare in disbelieve. "I saw you talking to him. I can imagine what he offered." You finish your stew, not really full but not feeling like eating anymore either. "I won't become a whore, not that it's any of your business" you snap at her and then worry she'll start hitting you, but she nods approvingly instead. "That's something at least. Edwin has a talent for snatching up all the pretty young girls, making them work for him and then throwing them out on the streets once they no longer attract enough suitors."

All of you finished your food, but nobody gets up. Now that Maira has put her nose in your business you feel it's fair to put yours in hers. "Then what does a respectable woman like you have to do with him? You spoke with him as well." She glares at you before scoffing. "Hah. Respectable. I used to be. Now I'm a mere slave. Edwin practically owns the tavern and is squeezing every copper out of it he can. It doesn't always go like today, most days we're empty for much of the evening. We don't have the young pretty girls he does. Well, not usually. Still though, with our amount of dept ..." She suddenly gets up, stacks the bowels and leaves towards the kitchen. "Huh, that must be rough" you comment towards Olin, but he just wordlessly gets up as well and goes up the stairs, leaving you sitting by yourself. *Yup, just like family* you think bitterly and make your way up to your room. You're not tired and wouldn't mind staying up long tonight, but there is no social media to check or games and shows to entertain you.

Once in your room you check the messages that have been piling up.
