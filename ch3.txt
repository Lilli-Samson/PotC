Alice leaves the dark alley and a moment later she is out on a much bigger street. Most of the houses seem to be shops; there are weapons, armor, clothes, food and a lot of small miscellaneous stores. They are all two stories high, the bottom with wares on display and the top apparently residential rooms for the shop owners. While this looks like a busy prestigious city center the place is remarkably quiet. The stores are all dark, but some of the second floors have lights on. It seems like people are not very active during the night here. You hear faint voices in the distance and wander in that direction. Soon you found the night life of the place, some taverns with music playing inside, a lot of infrequent laughter and signs advertising women's services in suggestive pictograms. You'll definitely have to check those out. Despite being a girl yourself you still like girls and wouldn't mind having one explore your body with you. You're much less in the mood for horny men being pigs towards you, even though that would be better for your coin purse.

"Hey you! What are you doing out at night?" You spin around and duck instinctively. There is what seems to be a guard looking at you, looking like a knight in his full plate armor. He it pointing a pike at you and starts walking in your direction. You quickly wonder what to do. You could wait and have the guard yell at you for being out, explain to him that you're from out of town and get an introduction to the world. You're pretty sure that's what you're supposed to do at least, but you also don't like to get railroaded. Your mischievous nature breaks through and you decide to skip the tutorial. You turn and run down the street, unlike in your last life feeling quick on your feet, able to run faster for longer. "HEY! STOP!" you hear the yelling behind you and the loud clanking of iron on cobble stone, but it soon becomes faint and you slow down.

You seem to have left the nightlife area; the small densely packed houses replaced by larger houses; stables and what look like barracks. You see guards in the distance and stick to the walls, hiding as best as you can in this open area. Unlike the previous guards these also wear a helmet that seems to reduce their peripheral vision enough that they don't spot you right away. *I just spawned and am already running from the law* you think to yourself, your heart beating a little faster at the thought of getting caught. You check out the building more thoroughly now. It's made of massive stone and four stories high. The small windows, a steel door and the two heavily armored guards make this look more like a fortress than a building. *I wonder what they have in there that's worth guarding.* Just as you think that you get another popup.

You didn't expect that. It's as if the game read your mind. It also warned you that you would likely fail, but you don't particularly mind. You're curious now and want to give it a shot. You can always log out if it gets too intense. Having made up your mind you accept the quest. You half expected a quest marker to appear telling you where to go, but nothing happens besides the popup disappearing. You're a bit at a loss for how to go about this. You're pretty sure there is no way you can break down a huge iron door. You're not even sure you could take out a guard. Scaling the building seems out of the question as well; the bottom floor is smooth stone without windows and you lack a roped hook. *Maybe I can find one?* You have no idea where to look. Buying one from one of the shops is your best guess, but that would mean delaying the quest until tomorrow and you don't feel like waiting.

You pace around trying to think of something, only to get interrupted as a guard gets dangerously close to you. You're not sure what their vision range is, but it felt a lot better to hide around a corner than to trust not to get caught again. You have a feeling that being caught here after skipping the first guard would not go as smoothly anymore. Sighing you turn to the stables, sneaking around despite apparently nobody guarding the horses. You climb into a window and drop onto hey only to get startled by a loud neighing of a horse that must have been equally startled by you. "Shh!" you tell it and then look around. There is an oil lamp giving out a faint burned smell and light. You're sort of trapped in here, but the stable doors are easy to unlock provided you have hands, even from the inside. There is some water intended for the horse, but you don't feel quite thirsty enough for that yet. All in all it seems safe to stay the night here, but you're not feeling tired. You want to do the quest. You remember that you do have a skill that in theory is suitable here even though you thought it never would. "Well, here goes nothing. Be a good horse and tell me if someone comes, yes?" The horse meanwhile seemed to have gone back to sleep, not caring about having to share the place with an Elf.

You sit cross-legged like you remember from monks and close your eyes to try to concentrate. Concentrate on the important things, ignore the unimportant things. In your mind you're standing in front of the treasury again, the big iron door closed, guards at the ready. Maybe the guards will be relieved at some point and open the door? That would mean there are 4 guards in the way though. You notice the smell of the small lamp again. Maybe it's your heightened senses or your nature affinity that take offense to it, but you do wonder how such a small lamp can smell so bad, drowning out even the smell of the horses tenfold. Maybe you could blow a hole into the wall with some dynamite ... that you don't have. You wrinkle your nose. This place wasn't so great after all. Maybe if you snuff out the light you might be able to ....

Your eyes open and you're wide awake. *That's it!* You open the door of the stable and go through the rows of horses, opening each one. Some of the horses look up to you, but they seem very tired and not in the mood to get up investigate what you're up to. They would soon change their mind. You take the lamp that no longer smelled so bad and look at it closely. There is a little tank in the bottom holding the oil, a wick to suck it up and a weak flame on top of it covered by glass to protect against wind. You remove the glass and flip the lamp to its side, placing it next to one of the hay bales. With the oil leaking out the flame quickly becomes bigger and soon start climbing the hay. The horses around you are getting increasingly nervous and start neighing again. Domesticated or not, their instincts told the horses that fire is a danger they need to flee from. You wait a little bit longer and then open the big front door, giving the horses an escape route. You didn't think they would actually be able to escape the city, but escaping the fire and causing some chaos is all you need them to do. You turn back to the hay and it's now engulfed in flames and the next wooden beam was starting to catch on fire as well.

"Time to go" you hear your girly voice say to yourself, but some of the horses get up and look at you. You wonder if that is just a coincidence, but don't have time to dwell on it. You quickly run outside, ducking behind trees and corners until you find a spot where you can see the treasury as well as the stables. You wonder if maybe the fire just burned out, but then you hear the horses darting out of the stables, their iron-clad hooves resounding in the night. Then you see the guards shift in front of the door, looking at the stables and then seeing the flames licking up over the roof. "Fire!" you hear one of them scream and hammer against the door with his iron gauntlet. a moment later you hear the ringing of bells as more and more rooms in the treasury light up and guards scramble around, trying to organize buckets and water as well as trying to catch the horses running through the streets. You smile at the chaos you caused and almost want to call it a day, but a quest update interrupts you.

***Optional:*** ~~*Do not alert the guards*~~ **Objective failed**

*Oh come on!* you inwardly complain. You can see how you very much alerted the guards, but they were alerted to a fire, not to you. It totally shouldn't count. Though re-reading the description you have to admit it's unambiguous. Then you see a another guard step out, one without a helmet and without a pike. Instead he has a sword and a red cape over his armor. He is followed by a lot of guards. They are fairly far away, but he screams loud enough that you have no trouble hearing. "Group Heidegger! Surround the stables! Do not let other buildings catch fire! Group Asmus! Grab any buckets you can find and bring water from the cistern! Group Koffka! Go catch your horses." You expected a "Yes Sir!", but none came. Instead the guards just poured out of the building, splitting off towards the stables as well as other directions. Other guards start barking orders and you begin to feel uncomfortable that you'll be in so much trouble should you ever be caught.

You bite your lips, trying to calm yourself down and finding the courage to do what must be done. The guards wouldn't be busy forever, you have to act now. You put your cloak over your head and sneak towards the bit iron door that is now standing open. The two guards on the side are still there and they each have a torch. There is no way you'd be able to sneak past unnoticed. You could shoot them with your bow, but that is under your cape and you're not sure how much damage wooden arrows would do against steel armor. You'd probably just alert them to your presence. But since you've apparently already alerted the guards it technically doesn't matter anymore if they see you. You walk towards them, silent on your clothed feet, difficult to see in the dark due to your dark cloak. You walk casually as if you have business, wondering how far you'd get before they stop you. To your surprise you managed to get to a few meters before the guard turned his head, apparently not used to actually having to pay attention. "Halt! Who goes there-" he starts, but in that moment you dash between them. Before they are able to put their pikes to use you're already through the door, seeing a long corridor in front of you. You have no idea where you're going and didn't exactly plan this part out, but you have to keep running in order to not get caught.

You end up at a T-section, going right and left. To the right you see another big door with another two guards. *Shit.* You pull your head back quickly and peak around the other corner. More double guards in front of a closed heavy door. *This is not looking good.* There is another big door on the side, unguarded. You decide to take the unguarded door for now. To your surprise it actually opens, but once inside you see why. Instead of a treasure room you find stairs going up and down. You don't know where to go, but you should make a decision quickly.
