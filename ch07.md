You're finally back home. It's nice to be back, you missed so many of your things. You check your fridge, but it just has random food stuffs that require preparation. Maybe you should order a pizza. Pizza is nice. You missed having a bathroom and taking a shower after a long day. Your computer desk is still there and the computer is on. You're about to sit down and browse all the messages and posts you missed when you hear loud knocking on your door. It sounds like someone used their fist holding a metal chain. "Police, open up!" You wonder what they want. You're a law abiding citizen, there is no need to be afraid, but you can't help your heart beating a bit faster. After getting up and opening the door you see a man that looks vaguely familiar. It seems like he is wearing a cape which is definitely not standard police attire, but it's difficult to see from the front. He grins at you and then looks down; only then do you realize you're naked. "Sorry officer, I wasn't expecting anyone. I'll put something on right away." His grin disappears and he suddenly looks very serious. "Never mind that. Why are you an elf? Elves don't belong here." You stare at him in disbelieve, no idea how to react to that. "Elves don't get payment, but they get what's coming to them." Before you can react you feel a familiar pain in your stomach. Looking down you see he stabbed you with a sword. "But ... why? ...." you manage to press out before falling to the floor, wondering if you will ever again get it clean of the blood spilling out of you.

---

You wake up with a startled jump before taking a moment to remember where you are. You're in a bed with washed out light gray bed cloth in a fairly brightly lit room. The thick blanket feels too hot now so you hug it instead of covering yourself with it, exposing your leg and naked backside. As you realize that you're still in the game world you sigh. You don't even need to check your dream wound to know it isn't there. *System: Log out. Confirm!*

>   ***ERROR**: As you are wholly present in the Realms, the system can no longer return you to your world of origin.*

It was worth a try. Reluctantly you look through your notifications.

**Congratulations! You have reached levels  8 through 9 in Stealth.**
**Congratulations! You have reached levels  1 through 3 in Exhibitionism.**
Exhibitionism is the Skill of exposing yourself to others in a way that increases both your own and their arousal and desire. Skilled exhibitionists can make anyone blush in unrivaled excitement, including themselves.
Exhibitionism is a Subskill of Sex.

*Thanks game* you think sarcastically. First the game made you run around naked and now you got a skill for doing it better. *And with an Affinity of 69%. Perfection.* Apparently you *can* get high Affinity scores after all and your greatest Skill is ... showing off your naked body.  *System: Log out. Confirm!*

>   ***ERROR**: As you are wholly present in the Realms, the system can no longer return you to your world of origin.*

One of these days it will work. You are curious what other sex skills there are and who made those. The Realm wasn't advertised as a naughty game per se, but it was rated 18+.  
Then you see another notification.

> Know this: You have acknowledged a debt of deeds to Maira. Reneging on this debt will have grave consequences.
> Always remember, words have power.

After a bit of frowning you figure that the game means you agreed to help Maira out in the tavern and apparently if you flake on her you'll get punished. You almost have a mind to not do any work just to see what exactly those grave consequences will look like. You'll see how it develops. You can't imagine the consequences being overly bad since you barely took anything of value, but games are not always logical. Still, that power words are supposed to have here is definitely worth looking into.

Now that you're properly awake and have good light you take another more calm look around. The room's walls are white but not very even. Especially the corners are rounded. Wooden beams hold up the ceiling. There is bright sunlight shining into the glassless open window. You're not sure how long you slept, but you don't think you slept more than 24 hours and it seems to still be around noon, so you must only have slept a few hours. Either that or the days here are much longer.
The bed's mattress seems to be just another thick blanket on the wooden bed frame, making it feel both softer to light touch and harder to lie on. An actual mattress would be more comfortable, but overall it's not bad. You know you should get up and go talk to Maira, but looking around no clothes have appeared and you feel a little awkward about the whole situation. Walking down those stairs completely naked in broad daylight might do wonders for your best skill, but it could also get you thrown out.

You think back to yesterday's adventure, how you ran around completely naked and were seen by not only guards but also the old man who was leering at you. Maybe with more levels in Exhibitionism his lust would have won out against his fear and you would be sleeping there now. And then there was Olin. You are sure his mind can only think of one thing, fucking you senseless with that big dick of his. Your hands wander down between your legs almost by themselves, feeling your new sex. It is smooth and soft, though once your finger splits the folds there is a little bit of wetness and you involuntarily gasp as a slick fingertip runs over your new clit. You close your eyes again, gently playing with that little button that is giving you so much pleasure, different than what you're used to. You imagine walking down the stairs in the nude after all, your hips swaying and Olin seeing not only your naked body but the wetness between your legs as well.

You are getting into it more and more, moaning softly into the pillow, something you never did before, but now it feels natural. It somehow feels better than when you played with yourself using your real body. You need to get rid of this tension; once Maira knows you're awake you won't be able to have any private fun time anymore. You imagine both the old man and Olin in the room with you, each of them watching you intently. You turn more onto your belly, still hugging the blanket, now with your naked butt in the air, giving your imaginary audience a show playing with yourself. In your mind Olin walks up behind you, including the stairs creaking, until you actually hear the door open.

You freeze in your movements and try to breathe naturally, keeping your eyes closed. Your heart is racing, both from your lewd imagination and the fact that you might just have been caught masturbating. Your face flushes red in embarrassment, but thankfully it's pressed into pillows so whoever is behind you can't see it.  
There is an awkward pause and for a moment you wonder if you just imagined the noise, but then hear careful steps being taken towards the bed. Rationalizing decisions you know are wrong seems to be something your brain is really good at lately and especially in your currently horny state you talk yourself into leveling up your character's best Skill. Your fingers are still between your legs and you're pretty sure it's clear to your observer what was going on, so you arch your back more, giving an even better view of your bare bottom and tentatively run your finger through your slit again, now almost dripping. Your nipples are itching and you again imagine being watched and then taken by Olin, your pussy clenching in anticipation as the fantasy is so close to being fulfilled.

"OLIN?" you hear Maira yelling from downstairs. The poor guy must be hard as a rock and unable to do anything about it as long as Maira is on his case. You hear him move sluggishly, putting something on the table and then leaving through the door. You turn around to the table seeing some clothes and then jump as you see Olin still standing in the corridor, looking directly into your eyes. Your head turns beet red, giving out another small moan as he watches your glistening pussy clench again but don't dare to touch yourself. "Olin!" He seems to be fighting with himself if he could just drop his pants right now and rape your virgin pussy for teasing him like that, no longer caring what his mother might say or do, but in the end the fear wins out. "Yes, Ma" you hear him say more towards you than down the stairs and with clenching teeth and all his Willpower he manages to tear his gaze off you and go down the stairs. "She woke up."

You breathe a sigh of relief, not sure if you're happy or disappointed he didn't end up ravaging you. You're still excited, but you don't think you'll be able to make yourself cum before one of them comes back and while you wouldn't mind giving Olin another show you're afraid Maira would just throw you out, so you reluctantly get up and again look at the clothes on the table. It's a dark green dress with long white sleeves. After a moment of hesitation you slip the dress over your head, finding the arms and pull it down. It's a little big for you and you feel like your breasts don't quite fill it out as it was meant to, but it's good enough and definitely better than running around naked. Probably. Maybe. You can't quite tell in your current state.

You shake off those thoughts and check for anything else Olin might have brought you, but there is nothing, no shoes, bra or panties. A mirror would again be very helpful, but there is none in your room. You will have to get one, assuming they exist here. You're not quite sure what technology level is required for mirrors, but middle age mirrors probably existed. *Maybe they were expensive.* You take a deep breath and go down the stairs, look into the service area without seeing anyone and then follow the noise of burning wood crackling into the kitchen where you see both Maira and Olin.

Maira sees you and immediately walks towards you. "There you are! Up already? Well, must be your youth. I see Olin managed to give you the dress, even if he took forever. Let me see." She pulls and tugs on it in various ways, once almost making your breasts spill out and you give a sheepish look to Olin who seems transfixed on your cleavage now that the rest is hidden. "It'll have to do. I don't keep many clothes that don't fit me and my other clothes definitely won't fit a skinny thing like you. Anyway, where are my manners? I'm Maira and this is my son Olin." You nod towards him and with a slight blush and turn to Maira. "I'm ... uh ... Alice." She gives you an evaluating glance. "Weird name. How do you spell that? Never mind, it's elven, right? What does it mean?" You look at her expectant expression and feel like you're required to answer her question with something exotic. "Uh ... yeah, it's elven. It means ... uh ... it's complicated, but basically it means 'Girl lost in a world of dreams'. There is a story involving a rabbit and a cat and ..." but she is no longer listening, glancing at the door and then at the fire place in the kitchen. "Olin, bring the water upstairs and show her around. And I better not see any inappropriate behavior or I'll get *really* mad!" You wonder if she will beat him up just as a precaution, but he picks up the heavy bucket with warm water and starts his way upstairs. "The first guests might arrive soon and you have to be clean. You can't go out smelling like that. Go wash up." You don't feel like you smell bad and wonder if she just wants you gone right now. She turns around and goes through cupboards before stopping you again. "And don't let Olin get away with anything! If he does something weird you yell at him and hit him. Or you call me to do it. He is a good boy, but sometimes he lacks manners and comes up with crazy ideas." She shakes her head at nobody in particular and puts another bucket with water over the fire place. You stop watching her and get moving before her anger can turn towards you.

Your body is full of energy and your light feet get you quickly up the stairs. You find Olin in what seems to be a wash room, the floor a little bit tilted so water will drain out towards a hole in the wall. He hangs the bucket on a hook in the middle of the room and then turns towards you. There is a light blush and a sheepish smile on your face while he still seems to just stare at you. "So ... how does this all work?" He just keeps staring. "Wood Elf. We use rivers, not bathrooms." You hope you're not making something up he knows to be false, but if you are he is not showing.

"There is soap and a wash cloth on the table. You stand under the bucket and pull the rope and it splashes you with water. Don't use up all the water at the start or you'll run out when washing off the soap." You grin, imagining how many times he must have done that and how many times Maira had to hit him to remember. "Then you dry off with this towel and you're done." He looks at you, apparently wondering if you understood what he was saying. You slowly walk towards him to the center of the room and grab the rope attached to the bucket and pull a little. "Like this?" His eyes go wide and he takes a few steps back towards the door, not wanting to get splashed. "No! You have to take off your clothes first!" he says with a bit of annoyance in his voice, but then his expression changes when he realizes what he said. "Ah, I see." You can't help smiling at him as you go over to the table and start pulling up your dress, revealing your long legs. Olin's resolve hardens, probably expecting you to do something like this and he turns to leave, but before you are out of his sight the bottom of the dress is pulled up over your hips and up over your head, getting your arms and head tangled in the dress unable to see momentarily while revealing everything.

You turn around towards the table and bend over, letting gravity help you with getting out of the dress. After you finally manage to pull it off you and straighten up he is still standing in the doorway, but now once again with a hand in his pants, stroking himself. You take the soap and wash cloth and slowly stroll towards the center of the room, wondering if he will cum in his pants. *Maybe I'll unlock an achievement for that.* You turn your back to him and slowly pour water over your body. It's barely lukewarm, but since you're not freezing you don't mind. You soap up the cloth and start running it all over your body, not wanting to take overly long with this as there is no option to turn up the temperature.  
Then you get startled by yelling from the corridor. "What. Are. You. Doing?" Each word another whack with what seems to be a wooden spoon, though this time it looks like it actually hurts. You flinch with each hit just like Olin until Maira chases him down the stairs. She gives you a glance and sees your shocked expression, then follows him down together with a lot of yelling and hitting. You now feel sorry for Olin. He shouldn't have peeked, but you would have too and basically baited him into it.

You quickly wash the rest of your body, using soap for your hair which is probably not good and spend only an appropriate amount of time between your legs, washing off your juices but not making more of them flow. A few minutes later you used up all the water from the bucket and dry yourself off, put the dress back on and then dry your hair as well as you can with only a damp towel. They won't have a hair dryer here, so it will have to dry naturally. Fortunately it appears to be a warm dry day, so you're not worried about it. Once you're done you go down the stairs to see the aftermath of what happened between mother and son, but only manage to find Olin sitting at one of the tables. When you enter he glares at you but neither gets up nor says anything. You sit down at his table and wait a moment until his anger dissipated enough to look at you.
