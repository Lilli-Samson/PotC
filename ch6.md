The cold takes your breath away for a moment, making you shiver involuntarily and you feel even more naked than before. You check the log at what happened and then realize your Divine Protection Active Effect disappeared. Apparently that actually protected you more than you realized, but now that it's gone you cannot concentrate on it to check what exactly it did. You don't really have time for that anyway. The rough stone of the streets is hurting your feet, having also lost your mundane shoe protection even if it was just thick cloth. You protectively hold your arms over your breasts, not out of shame but to keep some of your body heat. It doesn't help much.

At first you run quickly through the awakening city that barely provides any cover. Dodging the guards though is more difficult than you anticipated, they seem to be patrolling everywhere and you have to stay between the patrols, going at the same slow walking speed as them to not get caught. Thankfully each door goes a little into the houses, giving you partial cover to the sides, so you can dash from door to door. You don't have time to think where you're going and just hope you'll somehow get lucky. While waiting for the guards ahead of you to get a move on, leaning against another door, it suddenly opens. In surprise and you take step forward onto the street, only to quickly step back in to not be seen by incoming guards. Inside you see an elderly man bending over to pick up a bucket with what appears to be waste water and is about to throw it out onto the street through the door, right over you. At the last moment he looks up, just as surprised as you were, stopping the bucket mid swing. Some of the liquid gets past the rim and splashes on the ground between you, making you jump to dodge most of it but then have to step into the little puddle with your naked feet. The old man stares at you, no, at your breasts, and soon his gaze drops between your legs.

You gulp and try to make the best of the situation. "Hi! Mind if I come in?" He looks back up to your breasts, taking in your hard nipples and finally at your face, only to look sort of past you. You try your best at a friendly smile, but your shivering blue lips ruin it a little and then you can tell he is staring at your ears. The lust in his eyes gives way to fear. "Y-you're ... you're an elf!" he exclaims and quickly tries to close the door. "Hey, wait! I have a bit of a situation here as you can see and ...", but before you manage to make up an explanation he yells out "GUARDS!" and you instinctively look down the street. "Shh! They'll hear you!", but it's no use, he closes the door in front of your face and you hear a latch put into place to make sure you're not getting in. "Shit!"

Behind you guards are moving in, not running, but they must have heard the old man calling out and want to check it out. Having no other choice you make a run for it, ignoring the yelling of the guards behind you to stop. As you run through the streets the number of guards chasing you seems to be steadily increasing and you feel like they'll corner you eventually. You don't feel like knocking on someone's door; based on the reaction last time your chances to be taken in are slim. To avoid getting caught you start trying just opening doors, hoping to find one unlocked. Maybe the owner of one of the houses works all day and you at least get some temporary rest, but so far all the doors have been locked. Finally on your last try before having to face the guards you find a door that opens. You quickly go inside and close it again, leaning against the inner wall looking through a window, expecting someone to rush in after you, but the guards seem to have all run past you. Then you take a look around and realize why the place was open.

It's a tavern with about ten tables and a bar, probably technically open but nobody drinks at this time. Then you see him, a big guy, broad shoulders and thick arms and legs. He wears a simple white linen shirt and brown pants, held up by suspenders on top of the shirt. Your heart races as you assess the man's reaction, wondering if he had been watching you all this time. You try to figure out if you need to flee immediately, but he just stares dumbly at your body. His eyes run all over it and you brush your long hair behind your ears, partially just to get the elf thing over with, but he doesn't seem to notice or care. He takes a few steps closer and you uncomfortably wonder if you should take your chances with the guards instead of this brute, but then get distracted by his big hand slipping into his pants, clearly stroking himself to your image.

You bite your lower lip, unsure what to do. Being lusted after so obviously is a bit arousing, but you're also cold and tired. Glancing outside again you see that it's bright enough that you won't be able to hide at all, sticking out with your pale skin and black hair, but staying here with this man doesn't seem safe at all either. *Maybe if I let him have his way with me and then he'll leave me alone?* He takes another step closer, getting almost in range to touch you, but then you hear a loud yell from a woman. "Olin! Where are you? What are you doing?"  
You both look at the corridor the yell came from before looking at each other again. He seems to try to think about what to do with you and finally makes a decision. He drops his pants, giving you a good view of the penis he has been stroking to full hardness surrounded by a forest of pubic hair. It looks big. Well, it looks proportionate, he is a big guy after all, but compared to your rather petite form it looks huge. You change your mind; letting him have your way with you is a terrible idea. He staggers forward, his pants around his ankles not allowing him to move properly, but he still manages to grab one breast while your back is against the wall.

"Olin! Why don't you answer me? What are you doing? What ... who do you have there?" You see an older woman come through the corridor, take a look at you, the man's hand on your breast, your naked body and finally the naked butt of Olin. She seems a bit fat and older, wearing a blouse and a skirt that show off her big cleavage as well as her equally big thighs. You see her getting angry and wonder if you just ruined a marriage.  
"Olin! How many times have I told you not to touch yourself like that?" She waddles over to him. "Get. Away. From. Her!" she hits the man's arm with every word, looking almost comically since he is a good head taller than her, but she is still making him flinch and almost trip and fall over his pants. "Put those back on! And stop wanking!" she pushes him over to a table and stares at him angrily until he pulls his pants up. Then her eyes turn to you.

"And what do we have here, huh? A naked elf. Oh the fun the guards will have with you." You can't quite tell if that is a threat or if she feels sorry for you. Hoping for the latter you try to convince her to not let them have you. "Please, don't send me away. I just need a place to sleep and some food. I'll be good I swear!" You watch her reaction, her mind apparently going through the options. "How will you pay for it? I'm sure you don't have any money on you and ... I don't want a whore." You gasp at the accusation and look offended, but considering you thought about letting that big guy fuck you in exchange for a few hours of sleep in a bed she is not far off. "I ... uh ... I can clean and ... help you out?" you offer, but it's more of a plea. She considers again, scratching her cheek. "I *could* use some help here, but ... you're an elf. You don't get any payment." You blink at her, wondering if she is racist or if this is the law here. You plead again. "I just want a place to sleep and some food. I've been up all night. Please." By now your tiredness has caught up and you're at that point where you normally pass out on your bed.

The decisions is made for her by a loud knock on the door and in that moment you know the guards have found you. You give another pleading look at her before she nods towards the corridor and you mouth a quick silent "Thank you" before running into it. Behind you you hear multiple guards entering. "Have you seen an elf around? Looks like this." You don't dare to peek at what 'this' is and check out the other rooms connected to the corridor. There is a dark storage room, a kitchen, a back door to the streets and stairs up. You decide to take the stairs, but go slowly to avoid them creaking. Also you want to listen in on what they are arguing about back in the service area. "Maira, it's not that difficult. Pointy ears. Have you seen any?" a guard says. "I don't think so. There were some guests here yesterday that I didn't recognize, but I don't think any of them had pointy ears. But some of them wore hooded capes, so I'm not sure." The guard scoffs. "What about you, Olin? Seen anyone like this?" You can imagine clearly the same dumb expression Olin must be giving the guard as he gave you and it makes them lose patience.

"Ok, search the place, don't miss a spot!" You hear loud protests from the woman that must be Maira along with the heavy foot steps of guards rushing in. You quickly move up the stairs, finding multiple bedrooms, a washroom and a window. On a whim you rush to the window that faces the wall of another house about 2 meters away. You climb out considering jumping down to the streets, but the hard cobble stone make that seem like a terrible idea. Also you'd be back at square one, running from guards, only this time they'd see you from far away. Instead you lean out and turn, look up to the roof and see a sign there with symbols of a bed and a beer glass and start climbing up onto the roof, grabbing and then stepping on the sign to scale the otherwise smooth wall. It takes you all your strength to climb up, not even having time to check if anyone might be seeing you from below, but soon you're lying on top of the straw roof. The tavern seems to be a little higher than other nearby buildings, but in the distance you can see the treasury and other higher buildings. You lie down flat without moving, the hard straw poking your skin, hoping to just get lucky about not being spotted. You can hear the guards in the tavern rooms below, opening doors and cabinets while Maira is yelling at them for touching her clothes. Eventually they are done searching and the first guard gives Maira a half-hearted apology. "You can never trust elves, they are vicious creatures. I had to make sure." Maira was fuming with anger. "And you think I'd give someone like that shelter? You're crazy. Out! Out with all of you! Come back later when you're off-duty. You owe me some orders."

After a while you hear the guards leave the tavern and move on to the next building, knocking on the door and demanding entry. You wonder if they already checked the old man's house and if he had given them a description of you. You consider falling asleep on the roof, but you're hungry, thirsty and afraid you'll turn in your sleep and fall down to your death, so instead you make your way back down into the window. Climbing out was easier than climbing in is; you managed to pull yourself up the protruding roof, but now you're having difficulty finding purchase with your legs on the window still. You try a few more times while your arms are getting tired and almost fall when two big hands grab at your legs and then your hips, pulling you in. Soon you find yourself pressed against Olin's body and slowly slide down against it, wondering how long he had been looking between your legs when you first tried to feel around for the window still with your feet before helping you. There is also the unmistakable bulge you're pressed against now and he looks you directly in the eyes, a deep need in his and tired awkwardness in yours, his arms unwilling to let you go.

"You found her!" Maira comes to your rescue again and he looks down. A little too late to hide what he was doing he reluctantly lets you go and gets out of the way. Mira gives you a worried look. "Thanks for not getting caught. I don't know how I would have explained that. You earned yourself a stay in the guest room and some food and drink, but you have to help out in the tavern later. Deal?" You just nod tiredly and she motions you over to a small room with a bed, a small window, a table, a stool and a big wooden chest at the bottom of the bed. There is a tray on the table with a wooden cup with water, some dried meat and a peeled potato. "Eat up and rest. You'll have lots of work to do in the evening." She looks over to Olin and gets angry again. "Stop staring at the naked girl! Shoo! You have chores to do!" The big man flinches and turns around with a barely audible "Yes, Ma." Maira gives you a satisfied smirk and then closes the door.

Finally you're alone. You grab the meat and take a bite off it. It's too salty and chewy, but you're too hungry to care. The potato is hard and raw; thankfully your new teeth are good and you manage to gulp down the food and water quickly before falling onto the bed. The blanket and pillow are thick, warm and soft, something you hadn't felt since you came here. You don't know what will happen to you; Maira seems like someone who is out for profit, not charity and it is only a matter of time before she will not be there to stop her supposed son from molesting you, but right now you have to sleep. You'll have to figure out a plan and deal with the blinking notifications tomorrow.
