Back in your room you plop down on the bed, tired but too excited to sleep. You stare at the ceiling thinking back on the people you met and the things you saw. Olin gawking at your naked body, Cenric's hand sliding so close to your bare pussy and the image of that brunette choking on Edwin's dick to swallow all he had to give. Your nether regions react to the memories, but you try to keep your thoughts focused. You concentrate on the popups, not really wanting to go through them but ignoring them for too long will surely cause issues.

**Congratulations! You have reached levels 4 through 6 in Exhibitionism.**
**You are now a Novice in Exhibitionism; sexual acts are now slightly more fulfilling while being watched.**
**You have earned 50 experience points for advancing a Skill to Novice rank.**

You groan, having the game acknowledge your indecent exposure to Olin in this bed as well as in the bathroom makes you blush and a little excited. What is less exciting the the amount of experience points you got. 50 for leveling up a skill to level 5 seems like nothing compared to the 10000 you got for succeeding at a quest. To be fair it was above your level and the price for completing it was your life, but still. Leveling up through skill progression seems extremely slow, you'll have to get another quest earlier or later in order to progress. Though thinking about it you're not sure if gaining levels and skills is really what you need to focus on. Staying at your level until someone gets you out isn't a bad plan either and might save you therapy later. You wonder if the game gave you a tavern quest. Serve the tavern guests for a whole evening without incident. Considering how today went that would be an impossible task. Continuing on:

**Congratulations! You have reached level 1 in Masturbation.**
**Self-pleasure. Everyone does it, so don't be ashamed. A master masturbator isn't really that much better at the task, but they do have a wide variety of bonuses to other sexual situations.**
**Masturbation is a Subskill of Sex.**
**You are now Unskilled in Masturbation.**

Your face flushes red at being called out on that as well. You barely even played with your new body yet which is a small miracle in itself, though more of a testament to not getting any time to yourself in comfortable safety. Although you do have time now ....  
Thoughts of stripping down and just playing with yourself go through your mind, imagining letting Olin have his way with you, letting Cenric raise up your dress and everyone see your privates. Your hands wander down your body and raise up the dress to expose yourself, legs spread wide. The door is closed, but if you keep your eyes closed you won't know for how long. Your fingers find your moist opening, feeling more sensitive than earlier as if it was angry about not finishing what you started in the morning and the later teasing without release.  
You open your eyes and are a little disappointed that the door is still closed and nobody is peeking in. Lazy strokes from your fingertips keep you in a naughty mood while you look through more messages.

**Congratulations! You have reached levels 1 through 2 in Servicing.**
**Being attentive, doing everything to make your client happy, anticipating wishes and getting out of the way when not needed, Servicing can make the weight of the world seem more manageable and provide much needed relaxation.**
**You are now Unskilled in Servicing.**

You peek at the affinity and are somewhat relieved it's only 28%. You didn't feel destined to be a waitress, at least you don't want to spend months bringing drinks to men who'd take any opportunity to bend you over the table. Then again you notice that it says Servicing, not waiting tables. Surely there are other ways to service someone, but apparently you're not good at these other kinds either. You feel a little railroaded since your skills decide what you can and cannot do. Well, for now you haven't discovered any talent besides showing off your body and surviving. That doesn't really give you a direction, but at least the game tells you directly. It would be annoying to have the affinity be a hidden value. The next message is more interesting:

> ***Quest:*** *Tavern's Dept*
> *The tavern is in financial trouble. Help it flourish.*
> ***Success:*** *The tavern is out of dept and profitable.*
> ***Failure:*** *The tavern is closed.*
> ***Reward:*** *Improved relationship with tavern owner; a small amount of gold; 2000 experience.*
> ***ACCEPT/REFUSE***

Whoa, almost on queue, though not exactly what you expected. You read it over again and then accept. There is no penalty for failing, besides the obvious of not being able to get food and shelter here anymore along with opportunities to meet people once it closes. You don't think not accepting the quest would keep the tavern in business either, so there really is nothing to lose. Besides, 2k xp is a decent chunk, not as good as before but more than leveling your skills could give you. Unfortunately you don't know how to go about solving the issue. If only you had a 100 gold to just pay the dept. You are also offered another quest:

> ***Quest:*** *House of Depravity*
>   *Edwin Boltone's brothel offers unique opportunities. Investigate it to find out more.*
> ***Success:*** *Visit the brothel and discover at least one of its secrets.*
> ***Failure:*** *Leave Droan Fortress before completion*
> ***Reward:*** *Additional quests and hints; 500 experience.*
> ***ACCEPT/REFUSE***

Well, looks like you'll end up going to the brothel after all. You didn't intend to go before; while you don't mind sex or taking money for it, spreading your legs for the less attractive men of the town more than for a couple of nights isn't your thing. Despite the earlier safety concerns you don't want to get tied down here, you want to explore the world. It's what you originally came here to do after all and the best use of your time while stuck here. The same goes for waiting tables; it was fun today, it will be fun tomorrow and maybe the day after, but you can feel your enthusiasm waning already. In a week you will feel like you did at home, spending all your energy at a mediocre job in order to finance a boring life. You don't want to repeat that mistake, not in this world that offers real adventures. As real as it can at least. You accept the quest, confident you can go in a brothel and talk to people, maybe even sell your virginity to some rich asshole if the price is right. There are no more notifications or quests, so it seems like this is all you can do today. After a brief look at your character screen you let the use interface be for now.

The messages had distracted you from your side task, your pussy still wet and exposed with your fingers lazily stroking it, but no longer feeling as horny as before. You tentatively push your finger lower, feeling the slippery hole there, but when you try to push in you don't get far before getting stopped by the thin membrane of your hymen. You don't particularly care about it, you definitely won't lose it to a prince or a super meaningful way, but pushing against it hurts and touching your inner walls doesn't actually feel good, so you retreat back to the little button on top that feels much better. You briefly wonder if some developer actually implemented that hymen and if they used a real life model for that. You pull back your clit hood to expose that bundle of nerves to the cooling air and then your wet fingertips, causing you to give out a moan. Your body is too perfect. You do have the Flawless Body trait, but still, not even the most advanced sex games can model a clit hood that feels so ... natural. Even the tip of your ears feel like your own.

Your other hand goes to your breast, squeezing it first softly and then harder, causing you to gasp. You find your nipple and squeeze it gently at first through the fabric of the dress and then increase the pressure. It doesn't feel good exactly, it's more of a strange sensation that you don't quite know how to process. You stop before it hurts, but then feel in the mood to experiment more. You hold your now engorged nipple securely between thumb and index finger and start rubbing your clit in circles. After a while your pussy starts to involuntarily contract every so often while pinching your nipple harder and harder, offsetting the pleasure with naughty pain. You are so close to cumming and keep rubbing your clit while simultaneously squishing your engorged nipple, crying out in a mix of pain and pleasure as the treatment brings you back from the brink of an orgasm. Next time it won't be able to stop you, the involuntary moaning gets louder, your head thrashes from side to side until you hear loud dull banging against the wall right next to your head.

You freeze in shock and stare at the wooden wall, needing a moment to think clearly enough to figure out what happened. Someone knocked against the wall, that's for certain. Were you heard? How loud was your moaning? You blush, feeling ashamed at having been caught again but at the same time enjoying the naughty feeling. Maira's room is on the opposite side of yours so you figure this must be Olin's room. You would have expected him to stand in the door to watch though, not bang against the wall to make you stop. Thinking back, since the first guest arrived Olin had been rather cold to you, no longer lusting after you. Maybe his mom's punishment was so terrible that it managed to overshadow his horniness.

Being out of it again and unable to sleep you decide to get up, lick the wet fingertip and carefully open the door. It's somewhat dark in the corridor, no candles lighting it, but thanks to the window you climbed out of yesterday it's still bright enough for you to see the shapes well enough to walk around without bumping into anything. You try to be quiet and avoid any creaking of the floor. Once in front of the door next to your room where the banging came from you briefly consider knocking. It would be a distinct noticeable noise and you definitely don't want to wake up Maira. She'd ask questions you don't have good answers to and you're afraid she might beat you or throw you out, so instead you just quietly open the door and sneak inside.

Once in the room you close the door silently behind you and can vaguely make out Olin, his naked feet sticking out from under the blanket that he seems to have pulled over his head. "Hey" you whisper. Since he doesn't answer you go a step closer and go a bit louder. "Hey!"  
Suddenly the blanket flies open, making you jump back in surprise. "What are you doing here?" he asks sternly, staring at the intruder in his room. "Shh! Don't let your mom hear us!" That quiets him down and he sinks back into the bed with a sigh. "What do you want?" You're not quite sure of that yourself, but talking would about today would probably help. You take a step forward towards him, wondering if he can smell the wetness between your legs from there, your imagination making you aware of all the things he could do to you that you would be powerless to stop.

"I thought we should talk. You were strange today after ... after your punishment. Did it hurt a lot?" You can tell he glares at you, but you could have just as easily missed it in the relative darkness and eventually he realizes he'd need to communicate verbally. "No, it didn't." You wonder if he just doesn't want to admit it. "Well, I'm sorry I caused you trouble." Seeing as he won't get rid of you anytime soon he props himself up on his arms, giving you a view of his naked chest. It's somewhat hairy and with more muscles than you expected from a bar keep. "I'm sorry too. You should go sleep." You pause for a moment, wondering if maybe it is too early to talk, but you have a feeling he won't open up without getting pushed. "What did she do to you?"

He rolls his eyes in annoyance and you try yourself at a sweet seductive voice. "Maybe I can make it better, whatever it was." This seems to have pushed him over the edge as he rips the blanket off his body and stands in the middle of the of the room with you, scaring you with the speed, strength and anger in his movements. "You can't, ok! You're just making it worse." You bite your lip, afraid that maybe you overdid it and that Maira might be storming in, but then find enough courage to let your gaze drop down from his face past the hairy chest between his legs, expecting a raging hard-on, but then gasp at what you see. It doesn't look right, there is something that isn't supposed to be there and a moment later you press your hand over your mouth to suppress laughter. You ignore Olin's angry growl and drop down to your knees, right in front of his crotch, then carefully poke around at his privates. "I see. This has got to be frustrating" but your giggles make it sound insincere.

![Wooden cock cage](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828534005569159168/835433506079375360/cage.png)

There is a lock on top of it, almost as big as the cage itself, securely locking it to a ring around his balls so it cannot come off. You admire the contraption for a bit longer, even sliding a finger around his constricted balls until he sighs and sits back on the bed looking frustrated and defeated. You manage to stop grinning and sit down next to him, feeling safe from any sort of sexual harassment he might have otherwise been capable off. "I regret not having taken lockpicking as a skill" you look at him and then down. "I could have helped you out." Then taking the cage in your hand you add "Or rather: him out." You can't help but laugh again. He turns to the wall and you start to feel genuinely sorry for his predicament.
