Back at home the VR-set did its job of monitoring your vitals. People had actually died in VR due to dehydration and exhaustion, so now there are safety measures in place to avoid that as the law requires. Your pulse went too high and if it had stayed at that level for a little while longer the machine would have forcefully shut off. Now though there is no pulse at all. The first iterations of VR-sets would have called emergency services immediately in this situation, but it turned out that people often just got up and left without turning off their VR, leading to a lot of unnecessary ambulance trips and disgruntled players having to pay for them, but yours is a little more sophisticated and checks the weight first. It comes to about 50 grams. The player must have left, so it just goes in standby.  
Your home would have looked completely normal, if only there wasn't the pool of blood on the center cushion of your VR-set slowly drying and crusting over. It filled out and is now covering a cut, a few centimeters deep and wide into the cushion. That is all that can be found of you here.

---

You wake up just like last time, disoriented and unsure how much time you spent in the nothingness that you suspect is the loading screen. You wonder how much time total you've actually spent here. The alley seems a little darker this time, but you can still see decently well in the star light.  
Then the pain of getting stabbed by a sword in your stomach rushes back into your mind and you clutch at where the wound was, somehow expecting it to still be there. There is no blood, but your mind makes you imagine a drained wound that would open again if you just pull a little, but no amount of dragging at your skin reveals a cut. Then you notice that you're sitting butt-naked on the cobblestone. You see your skinny pale thighs and knees, then look a little lower to get a glimpse of your pussy that doesn't seem to feature any pubic hair and finally push your chest out and lower your head to get a good look at your boobs. You get up and inspect your body, really wishing you had your full length mirror from home. There is no hair on your arms or legs either, not even under your arms, it's just pale skin. You grab your boobs and squeeze them in your hands. They feel clearly bigger than before, more than a handful, but otherwise the feeling hasn't changed much.

But that is enough fun and perving on your virtual body for today. You concentrate on the interface, ignore all the popups and blinking notifications and finally find the command. *System: Log out. Confirm!*

>   ***ERROR**: As you are wholly present in the Realms, the system can no longer return you to your world of origin.*

*Wait, what?* You stare at the error message, having difficulty dealing with its gravity. It's telling you you're stuck here, but that's not possible. Immersion or not, games are not supposed to keep you prisoner in them. *Stupid buggy alpha* you complain. You sigh and wonder what to do now. Finally you decide to sit back down and go through the nagging notifications, hoping to find a way to get out.

**Congratulations! You gained level 6 in Stealth**

**Congratulations! You gained level 6 in Meditation**

**Congratulations! You gained level 6 in Doctrine of Kharn**

**Congratulations! You gained level 7 in Stealth**

**Congratulations! You gained level 1 in Bluffing**
Bluffing is the skill of having extraordinary claims taken at face value. A master of Bluffing is able to make whole armies stand down using only a few well-chosen words.
Bluffing is a subskill of Persuation. You are now unskilled in Bluffing.

> #YOU HAVE DIED
> 
> As you are Chosen, Death's door is not a one-way trip for you. Your soul has forced its way back into the Realms, but at a cost.
> Each time you die, you will lose all progress towards the next level, as well as a random amount of progress in every known Skill, up to 1 full level (to a minimum of level 1.00). In addition, it takes time for your soul to re-form your body and return to your spawn point. When you respawn, only objects which were bound to your soul and on or very near your person will respawn with you. All other objects will remain with your corpse. Finally, as this is your first death, your soul's passage was exceptionally turbulent. Ways that were open to you in the past are now shut; you are now wholly present within the Realms and may no longer return to your original world.

*Oof.* The message that you're stuck here makes this seem intentional and not a bug. Someone will definitely get fired for this, but there is nothing you can do about it right now and you also don't want to be the one reporting them due to the associated troubles, so you will just have to keep going. The rest of the message you basically already knew or at least suspected. An experience penalty on death is pretty standard. You do like the Bluffing skill and make it a goal to get that leveled up, then glimpse at the Affinity of 38%. *Not too shabby* you think, considering the generally low Affinity scores you seem to have. You may never be great at any skill, but it doesn't seem to hold you back either, at least not for now. You glance over your skill levels and see that Archery and Survival went down to level 4, but otherwise there doesn't seem to have been a loss of skill levels. *Great. The skills I can't level back up.* You shake your head and keep going through the notifications.

> #***You have completed a Quest!***
> 
> ***Droan Fortress Treasury:***
> ***Requirement:*** *Enter the treasury, steal something and leave* -- **Success**, stole Ethereal Dagger
> ***Reward:*** *+1 level of infamy, 10000 experience*  
> ***Additional Rewards:*** *Ethereal Dagger, Kharn's favor*  

**You have earned 3,850 experience for killing 1 Guard Captain.**

**Caution! Your reputation with the Droan Fortress Guards has fallen from neutral to hostile.**
They now view you as an enemy and will attacked on sight. Be careful not to make too many enemies; nobody can succeed alone!

> #***Congratulations! You have advanced to levels 2 through 6!***
> 
> *As a Chosen Wood Elf, you have 20 attributes to distribute and your Attractiveness, Senses, Agility and Speed increase by five. You also gain five instances of 25% advancement towards any one Skill. Allocate these within 72 hours or they will be randomly assigned.*
> *Honor thy Patron and follow thy heart!*

*Holy crap! That's a huge jump in levels! I guess I really wasn't supposed to succeed at that quest.* You feel like you have abused the system a little, but the system has abused you as well, so it just makes it even. Then you stare at those last two sentences of the message. *Honor your Patron and randomly assign points. Could they be any more obvious?* You wonder if you're supposed to not assign anything in order to keep your Sky Daddy happy, but then remember there is no sure way to worship your Patron. If it was as easy as not assigning points and skills someone would have figured that out by now. Plus you're a little worried to screw up your build even more than you already have. It seems like you're stuck now, at least for a while until your VR system shuts off by itself, so you'll have to make do until then. You know it has a timer and will do a hard break after 8 hours, so it hasn't been that long since you started. It definitely felt longer than that though.

**Congratulations! You are now unskilled in Daggers**
**Being small and fast, Daggers lend themselves well to concealment and surprise attacks. They are easy to use and effective, however, their limited damage potential makes them ill-suited in fights against large foes.**

*Wait, what was I before unskilled? Inept? I guess 'unfamiliar'.* That kinda makes sense for magic that you're actually unfamiliar with, but not for things like daggers and armor. *If only they'd give me a list so I knew what else I'm unfamiliar with.* You think back to the character creation screen and the long list of skills they shoved into your face that you didn't want to see at the time but banish the thought. It feels much better to blame the game design and even objectively the game is highly flawed. But it also clearly has potential to become great once they manage to iron out the various issues. You had actually gotten scared and invested back in the treasury, something games usually don't manage.

You look over your Attributes and consider what to put points into. Your racial points seem to already cover what you want. Attractiveness is probably a waste of attribute points, especially since you feel like with your body you will have no issues at all attracting attention, even unwanted. You didn't have any such issue with that in your real life, but now you can imagine how horny men might get annoying.  
There are two other skills you sort of want. One is Might, thinking being able to ram your dagger deeper into your enemy would probably deal more damage. Also drawing a bow requires a lot of strength. In reality bows are strength weapons even if games tend to make them dexterity-type weapons for balance reasons, but you have a feeling this game will not compromise realism for balance. Also you're somehow pretty sure Might translates to weapon damage in general which will surely become relevant.
The other interesting Attribute is Willpower. You don't know how, but you can tell it will greatly improve your Concentration and a little bit your Health and Stamina. It would also improve spell casting, but that part is wasted. However, you really need the Concentration for your only ability. You didn't forget about how it allowed you to kill that guard captain, even if that might not have been the best use of it. In hindsight you feel almost confident that with the world slowed down like it was you could have run past the heavily armored guards, easily dodging their attacks and pushing them out of your way. At least until your Concentration had run out, then you would have been screwed.  
In the end you decide to put five points each into Might, Willpower, Agility and Speed. You're a little worried about your dump stats, Toughness and Endurance. Your Health and Stamina will be garbage, but it cannot be helped. You won't be a tank and you won't fight long battles. Your strength lies in surprise attacks and using Mind Overdrive to kill anything that moves before they have a chance to react. If they are still standing after your Concentration runs out you're a sitting duck. Either way fights will go fast. You also wonder if you should have put points into Luck since leaving things to chance is a major part of your archetype, but it's too late now. Until you find a way to reskill that's what you got, or you'll just fix it next level up. Then you take a close look at your character sheet:

![Alice Character Sheet](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828534005569159168/830489224213954611/Alice_ch5.png)

You don't remember all the details of what it said before, but it seems like your Health, Stamina and Concentration all went up by roughly 50%. That's probably good. You were planning to give up Stamina in favor of Health and Concentration, but it seems like the system doesn't let you do minmax builds. At least not the way you're doing it currently. You wonder what would happen if you had just dumped everything in Attractiveness. It would not help you in a fight, but they might still force you to do quests. You have to admit you really don't know as many details about this system as you would like.

Then you check your skills. You notice that the Affinity percentages have gone down slightly, Doctrine of Kharn was at 10% before. *Wait, if I keep dying I'll eventually end up with all lvl 1 skills and 0% Affinity, making leveling skills impossible?* That seems rather bad and probably not intended. You'd have to do die twice per level on average, but still, dying 15 times would likely remove all skill progression and doesn't seem at all unrealistic. You can see how you might try a high level quest multiple times or fighting a boss more than 30 times before you give up; you've grinded bosses before in other games. You'll have to be more careful with your life here after all, dying is not as free as it seemed at first, causing lasting character damage. Additionally considering that your equipment and gold are gone as well and there is no way you can recover it from your corpse.  
Thinking back to your skill progression and the levels you could assign you can't really make up your mind. The skills you use level up by themselves, the ones you don't use don't matter. You should probably concentrate on skills with low Affinity since those are more difficult to level and the 25% is a flat percentage regardless of Affinity, but on the other hand once you hit 0% you can't level them up anymore and all usages will be wasted in terms of skill progression. In the end you don't care enough for any of your skills and just don't bother picking any of them. Let Kharn decide in 72 hours. Maybe he will put all into a specific skill and give you a sign, but then again that seems out of character; he'll probably be completely fine with truly random allocation and so are you.

That's it for now, no more important messages that you can see. You look out of the safety of your alley, but all you can make out are distant foot steps of what you presume must be guards in their metal boots. You can feel it getting brighter, it's not as dark anymore as when you woke up and went through the menus. *It must be close to morning.* You also wonder why you're not freezing. It's pretty cold and you're completely naked. You feel the cold of the cobble stone on your feet, but it doesn't bother you much. However, you do feel overly tired like when you had stayed up way too long into morning because you couldn't sleep, a sort of tired where eventually you just pass out. You're a little worried that the source of this tired feeling might be your real body getting exhausted, but your VR would have woken you up if that was actually the case. You try not to worry since there is nothing you can do about it anyways. Also you feel a little hungry. Not bad enough that you have to eat now, but after sleeping for eight hours or so you will definitely be waking up starving. Seeing as you really want to find a bed for the night, or day, and don't want to sleep in this alley due to a lack of food and a bed you try to remember what you know about this place. To your surprise the system helpfully volunteers information you vaguely remember from the character creation screen.

**Droan Fortress: An immense citadel-town situated on the border between the nations of Gilhardt and Feralon. Non-humans are extremely rare in the area around Droan Fortress, but for a human, there are plenty of possibilities. Recommended paths: Military, Spy, Smuggler, Criminal.**

*Getting isekaied into the racist area as the wrong race. Just my luck. At least I'm on the recommended path as a Criminal.* You look up at the sky and worry at the stars slowly disappearing due to getting increasingly out-shined by the rising sun. The night has given you some amount of cover; there is no way you can go out naked in broad daylight. Not only is it embarrassing, you also would be killed by the guards over and over or worse. There is no real choice, going now and hurrying is your only option. You slowly step forward to the edge of the alley, seeing guards patrolling in pairs and some people opening blinds of their windows. It's bad, but the longer you wait the worse it will get. After the guards you were watching turn into a side street you start running, keenly aware of your breasts bouncing slightly and the sudden cold that hits you, making your nipples stand at attention from the cold wind hitting them.
