Back at home the VR-set did its job of monitoring your vitals. People had actually died in VR due to dehydration and exhaustion, so now there are safety measures to avoid that required by law. Your pulse went too high and if it had stayed at that level for a little while longer the machine would have shut off. Now though there is no pulse at all. The first iterations of VR-sets would have called emergency services immediately in this situation, but it turned out that people often just got up and left without turning them off, leading to a lot of unnecessary ambulance trips and disgruntled players having to pay for them, but yours is a little more sophisticated and checks the weight first. It comes to about 50 grams. The player must have left, so it just turns off by itself.  
On the center cushion of the machine is blood pooling and slowly drying. It filled out and is now covering a cut, a few centimeters deep and wide into the cushion. That is all that is left of your body.

---

You wake up just like last time, disoriented and unsure how much time you spent in the nothingness that you suspect is the loading screen. You wonder how much time total you've actually spent here. It seems a little darker outside this time, but you can still see decently well in the star light.  
Then the pain of getting stabbed by a sword rushes back into your mind and you clutch at where your wound was, somehow expecting it to still be there. There is no blood, but your mind makes you imagine a drained wound that would open again if you just pull a little, but no amount of dragging at your skin reveals a cut. Then you notice that you're sitting butt-naked on the cobblestone in your starting alley. You see your skinny pale thighs and knees, then look a little lower to get a glimpse of your hairless pussy and finally push your chest out to get a good look at your boobs. You get up and inspect your body, really wishing you had a mirror. There is no hair on your arms or legs either, it's just pale skin. You grab your boobs and squeeze them in your hands. They feel clearly bigger than before, more than a handful, but otherwise the feeling hasn't changed much.

But that is enough fun and perving on your virtual body for today. You concentrate on the interface, ignore all the popups and blinking notifications and finally find the command. *System: Log out. Confirm!*

>   ***ERROR**: As you are wholly present in the Realms, the system can no longer return you to your world of origin.*

*Wait, what?* You stare at the error message, having difficulty to deal with its gravity. It's telling you you're stuck here, but that's not possible. Immersion or not, games are not supposed to do this. *Stupid buggy alpha* you complain. You sigh and wonder what to do now. Finally you decide to sit back down and go through the nagging notifications.

**Congratulations! You gained level 6 in Stealth**
**Congratulations! You gained level 6 in Meditation**
**Congratulations! You gained level 6 in Doctrine of Kharn**
**Congratulations! You gained level 7 in Stealth**
**Congratulations! You gained level 1 in Bluffing**
**The skill of having extraordinary claims taken at face value. A master of Bluffing is able to make whole armies stand down using only a few well-chosen words.**
**Bluffing is a subskill of Persuation. You are now unskilled in Bluffing.**

> #YOU HAVE DIED
> 
> As you are Chosen, Death's door is not a one-way trip for you. Your soul has forced its way back into the Realms, but at a cost.
> Each time you die, you will lose all progress towards the next level, as well as a random amount of progress in every known Skill, up to 1 full level (to a minimum of level 1.00). In addition, it takes time for your soul to re-form your body and return to your spawn point. When you respawn, only objects which were bound to your soul and on or very near your person will respawn with you. All other objects will remain with your corpse. Finally, as this is your first death, your soul's passage was exceptionally turbulent. Ways that were open to you in the past are now shut; you are now wholly present within the Realms and may no longer return to your original world.

*Oof.* The message that you're stuck here makes this seem intentional and not a bug. Someone will definitely get fired for this, but there is nothing you can do about it right now and you also don't want to be the one to report them, so you will just have to keep going. The rest you basically already knew or suspected as well. An experience penalty on death is pretty standard. You do like the Bluffing skill and make it a goal to get that leveled up, then glimpse at the Affinity of 38%. *Not too shabby* you think, considering the generally low Affinity scores you seem to have. You may never be great at any skill, but it doesn't seem to hold you back either. Yet. You glance over your skill levels and see that Archery and Survival went down to level 4, but otherwise there doesn't seem to have been a change in skill levels. *Great. The skills I can't level back up.* You shake your head and keep going through the notifications.

> #***You have completed a Quest!***
> 
> ***Droan Fortress Treasury:***
> ***Requirement:*** *Enter the treasury, steal something and leave* -- ***Success**, stole Ethereal Dagger*
> ***Reward:*** *+1 level of infamy, 10000 experience*  
> ***Additional Rewards:*** *Ethereal Dagger, Kharn's favor*  

**You have earned 3,850 experience for killing 1 Guard Captain.**

> **Your reputation with the Droan Fortress Guards has deteriorated from neutral to hostile.**
> *You will now be attacked on sight. Be careful not to make too many enemies; you cannot succeed alone!*

> #***Congratulations! You have advanced to level 6!***
> 
> **As a Chosen Wood Elf, you have 20 attributes to distribute and your Attractiveness, Senses, Agility and Speed increase by fife. You also gain five instances of 25% advancement towards any one Skill. Allocate these within 72 hours or they will be randomly assigned. Honor thy Patron and follow thy heart!*

*Holy crap! That's a huge jump in levels! I guess I really wasn't meant to succeed that quest.* You stare at those last two sentences. *Honor your Patron, randomly. Could they be any more on the nose?* You wonder if you're supposed to not assign anything in order to keep your Sky Daddy happy, but then remember there is no sure way to worship your Patron. If it was as easy as not assigning points and abilities someone would have figured that out by now. Plus you're a little worried to screw your build up even more than you already have. It seems like you're stuck now, at least for a while until your VR system shuts off by itself. You know it has a timer and will do a hard break after 8 hours, so it hasn't been that long you've been here. It surely felt long though.

**Congratulations! You are now unskilled in Daggers**
**Being small and fast, Daggers lend themselves well to concealment and surprise attacks. They are easy to use and effective, however, their relatively low damage makes them ill-suited for battles.**

*Wait, what was I before? Inept? I guess ''unfamiliar'.* That kinda makes sense for magic that you're actually unfamiliar with, but not for things like daggers and armor. *If only they'd give me a list so I knew what else I'm unfamiliar with.* You think back to the character creation screen and the long list of skills they shoved into your face that you didn't want to see at the time but banish the thought. It feels much better to blame the game design and even objectively the game is highly flawed. But it also clearly has potential to become great.

You look over your Attributes and consider what to put points into. Your racial points seem to already cover what you want. Attractiveness is probably a waste of skill, especially since you feel like with your body you will have no issues at all attracting attention, even unwanted. You didn't have an issue with that in your real life, but now you can imagine how horny men might get annoying.  
There are two other skills you sort of want. One is Might, thinking being able to ram your dagger deeper into your enemy would probably deal more damage. Also drawing a bow requires a lot of strength. In reality bows are strength weapons even if games tend to make them dexterity-type weapons for balance reasons, but you have a feeling this game will not compromise realism for balance. Also you're somehow pretty sure Might translates to weapon damage.
The other Attribute is Willpower. You don't know how, but you can tell it will greatly improve your Concentration and a little bit your Health and Stamina. It would also improve spell casting, but that part is wasted. However, you really need the Concentration for your only ability. You didn't forget about how it allowed you to kill that guard captain, even if that might not have been the best use of it. You feel almost confident that with the world slowed down you could have run past them, easily dodging their attacks and pushing them out of your way. At least until your Concentration runs out, then you'd have been screwed.  
In the end you decide to put five points into Might, five in Willpower, five in Agility and five in Speed. You're a little worried about your dump stats, Toughness and Endurance. Your Health and Stamina will be garbage, but it cannot be helped. You won't be a tank and you won't fight long battles. Your strength lies in surprise attacks and using Mind Overdrive to kill anything that moves. If they are still standing after your Concentration runs out you're a sitting duck. Either way fights will go fast. You also wonder if you should have put points in Luck, seeing that leaving things to chance is a major part of your archetype, but it's too late now. Until you find a way to reskill that's what you got. You'll be able to fix it next level up.

There is one more notification that is nagging you.

**Congratulations! You have been given a small degree of power by your Patron. Choose from the following options: Spy, Hunter, Adventurer, Assassin, Smuggler, Criminal. You have 30 seconds to choose; if this time elapses, one option will be picked randomly.**

You barely read through the message and then notice the time limit. You already spent like 15 seconds just reading it. You don't really feel like spying, you don't care enough about this world. There is nothing to hunt. Adventurer is probably the most reasonable, but really, you feel like retiring and waiting out the time. Then you think of your Patron and consider that it's power given by the god of RNG, so it only seems reasonable to let him choose. *Kharn giveth and he taketh away, or something like that.* Then the timer runs out. The menu disappears. You wait for a moment but don't get another popup, so you check your character sheet.

![Alice Character Sheet](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828534005569159168/829823002220429313/Alice_ch5.png)

You don't remember all the details of what it looked like before, but it seems like your Health, Stamina and Concentration all went up by roughly 50%. That's probably good. You were planning to sort of dump Stamina in favor of the others, but it seems like the system doesn't let you do extreme builds. At least not the way you're doing it currently. You wonder what would happen if you had just dumped everything in Attractiveness. It would not help you in a fight, but they would force you to do quests, right? You have to admit you really don't know as many details about this system as you would like.

*Oh right, my class.* Apparently you're a Chaos Spawn now. That seems about right. You've been screwing with the system from the beginning. You concentrate on your class to figure out what it does.

***Unlike other classes, the Chaos Spawn class does not focus on a particular purpose or role. Instead it allows picking traits and abilities from other classes when their conditions are met and only provides few unique options.***

That hadn't even been an option, at least not one you were made aware of. Apparently you had honored try Patron well enough that he gave you a special class. You cannot imagine many people getting that class. *Maybe common folk don't get a class at all. Besides 'Commoner'.*

#TODO: Manual skill advancements
#TODO: Affinity loss comment

That's it for now, no more messages that you can see. You look out of your alley but nobody seems to be around. You can feel it getting brighter though and it's not as dark anymore as before you went through the menus. *It must be close to morning.* You also wonder why you're not freezing. It's pretty cold and you're completely naked. You feel the cold of the cobble stone on your feet, but it doesn't bother you much. However, you do feel like when you've stayed up way too long at night, a different sort of tired where eventually you just pass out. You're a little worried that the source of this might be your real body getting exhausted, but your VR would have woken you up if that was the case. You try not to worry since there is nothing you can do about it. Also hunger is slowly setting in. Not bad enough that you have to eat now, but after sleeping for eight hours or so you will definitely be hungry. Seeing as you really want to find a bed for the night, or day, and don't want to sleep in this alley due to a lack of breakfast you try to remember what you know about this place. To your surprise the system helpfully gives you information you vaguely remember from the character creation screen.

**Droan Fortress: An immense citadel-town situated on the border between the nations of Gilhardt and Feralon. Non-humans are extremely rare in the area around Droan Fortress, but for a human, there are plenty of possibilities. Recommended paths: Military, Spy, Smuggler, Criminal.**

*Getting isekaied into the racist area as the wrong race. Just my luck.* You look up at the sky and worry at the stars slowly disappearing due to getting outshined by the rising sun. The night is giving you some amount of cover, there is no way you can go out naked in broad daylight. Not only is it embarrassing, you also would be killed by the guards over and over or worse. There is no real choice, going now any hurrying is your only option. You slowly step forward to the edge of the alley, seeing guards patrolling in pairs and some people opening blinds of their windows. It's bad, but the longer you wait the worse it will get. After the guards turn into a side street you start running, keenly aware of your bouncing breasts, the sudden cold that hits you and your nipples standing at attention due to the sudden cold wind hitting them.
