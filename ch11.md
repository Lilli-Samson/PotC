Olin looking so poor and frustrated puts a damper on your mood and you decide to have mercy on the man. Maybe not everyone would agree your next actions should be considered mercy, but you intended it as such. You sit on the bed next to his hip and put an arm on his chest half lying on top of him. You can feel him squirm under you, clearly bothered by your actions but not stopping you. "I'm actually sorry she did this to you and I'll see if I can do anything about it." You rub your hand over his chest and play with his hair, listening to his breathing getting more and more labored. Eventually he loses patience and grabs your hand tightly. "Then why are you teasing me like this? Is this fun to you?"

You give him a hurt expression, partially because he seems to think you'd just bother him for fun and partially because that grip actually hurts your hand. "It is. You're not the only one who gets into a certain mood. You should know that, you heard me after all." You blush but hold his gaze. "But if you don't want to play I'll leave you alone and keep quiet." He turns back to the wall and weakens his grip a little, but not enough to let you go. "I know you've been lusting after me ever since we first met. And unlike your mother I don't mind." He looks back again, surprised but also skeptical. Finally he manages to stammer out "Wh- what do you mean?"

"Well, you like looking at me, right? I know it's dark and you can't play with yourself, but ... maybe you'd still like to?" He swallows and nods, causing a slight smirk from you knowing that he is yours. "Tell me what you want." His eyes drop down to your chest covered by the dress and only showing a little cleavage, the same you've been showing all day to everyone, just more difficult to see now. He struggles trying to find the words while you push your arms down and together, making your breasts stick out a bit more to help him make up his mind. Or distract him more, either way the attention feels great. You still have to wait over a minute which to you feels much longer just sitting there in silence getting gawked at before he finally speaks. "W- would you show me?" You feel confident enough to start teasing him again. "Show you what?" you say with a smile. He rings with himself and finally presses out what he you want him to say. "Show me your breasts."

You give him a shocked look. "This is no way to speak to a lady! Has your mother taught you nothing?" You can only pretend to be serious for a couple of seconds before laughing. You push yourself up just enough to pull the dress out from under your butt, pull it over your head and let it drop on the floor. His flaccid cock is twitching and straining against the cage, unable to get big and hard like it wants to. You cross your legs, determined not to let him see any more of the juicy parts than he asked for. He stares again, but shorter than with the dress this time before he gets up. You're fairly sure this would be the point where he bends you over to still his lust, if only his dick had not been locked away. Instead he opens a drawer of his night stand and takes something out.

He stands with his back to you, blocking your view, so you can't see what he is doing, but a few seconds later he turns around with a lit candle placed in a small metal candle stick. While before it was fairly dark and you thought your elven eyes might be coping better with the darkness than his human ones you're sure he can see your naked body clearly now. Blushing you don't hide your breasts but keep your legs crossed, squeezing them together, waiting for him to ask to see more. "Can I touch them?" He looks at you expecting another jab at him, but you're just as excited of having your new breasts played with as he is playing with them. "Just don't be too rough."

He puts the candle down on the night stand and sits next to you, getting out of the way of the candle light to see better and then takes one breast each in his big hands, squeezing them gently and rubbing over your hardening nipples. You expected him to be all over you, squeezing hard and twisting nipples, but instead he is just carefully exploring, taking it all in. "They are not *that* delicate, you can give them a squeeze. Here" you put a hand over his, kneading your breast through his hand, adding pressure until you let out a little moan and then let him continue on his own. The touch itself still doesn't feel very stimulating, but the naughtiness of the situation gets you excited. He starts pulling on your nipples, giving you a different sensation that makes you gasp which in turn makes him be more careful again.

Watching him explore your body so timidly you wonder about his experience and decide to just ask. "Have you been with a woman before?" He withdraws his hands and looks hurt again. It takes a moment before you realize he understood it as criticism. "I didn't mean it like that. You didn't do anything wrong. I was just wondering." Slowly his hands return, lightly brushing over your skin now, sending shivers all over your body, more sensual than the kneading from before. "Mom never let me be with anyone. And even without her I wouldn't know who'd let me do this without paying."  
"Don't worry about it, I haven't been with anyone either." *At least not in this reality* you think as his eyes go wide. You briefly consider asking for compensation, but it doesn't feel right. "We'll figure it out together. But ... you'll have to stand up to your mother eventually, you know that, right?" He nods, but lacks conviction. You want to add that he did most of the work today, not her, but you're worried you might ruin the mood and decide to get back to what you were doing. "What else do you want me to show you?"

You hear him take a sharp breath in before collecting himself and seizing the opportunity. "Spread your legs. And lie down." You do as told, lying on his bed on top of the blanket and spread your legs as wide as they go with your feet on the bed, giving him the perfect view. He takes the candle from the night stand and puts it between your legs, illuminating your privates, staring at the hairless mound and a bit of redness from your earlier play. Your heart beats faster in anticipation and you make your pussy contract, wondering if it's glistening with wetness in the candle light as shadows dance over your body. Another long minute of just staring passes. Eventually you lose patience and let your hands slide down between your legs. One index finger pulls back your clit hood and the other dips into the moisture between your folds and then rubs over the little button. You moan quietly, wondering if this just naturally feels better than before because Olin is watching or if your Exhibitionism skill is doing work.

Either way, looking down you see him pulling at the cage, trying to give himself similar stimulation as you are experiencing but unable to do so. You don't want him to stay completely left out and since he doesn't take the initiative you make it your turn. "I've done as you asked, so now you have to do something for me." You see a worried look on his face but continue anyway. "I want you to lick my pussy. And I want you to make me cum." Now he looks puzzled, maybe unsure of what you're expecting of him or wondering if he should do it, but you get up and pull his head between your legs until his lips meet yours, making you gasp. "Lick me right there."

After an awkward pause where you wonder if you've been too direct and asked for too much he does poke out his tongue. It swipes lightly over your lower lips, tasting your wetness and apparently Olin isn't put off by it as he soon takes another lick and then another. Soon his tongue parts your folds, lapping up all of your juices and digging in his tongue for more. You look down into his eyes as he pushes his tongue in as far as it goes, wondering if it's possible to break your hymen with just his tongue. You grab his head and pull him higher. "I don't actually feel much down there. Lick the button on top." His mouth searches around and with the guidance of your hands he finds your clit, making you gasp again. "Oh yes! Yes Olin! This is how to make a girl happy." He eagerly licks and sucks on and around your clit, making you squirm at the strong stimulation. It's a little too much, but you don't want to stop his enthusiasm.

There is a lot of experimentation on his side, licking, sucking and even biting. Not all of it feels good, but he reads your reactions well. Eventually he latches onto your clit like a leech, making it swell and then flicks his tongue over it with fast upwards swipes. You can't help but moan loudly, making him stop as you both worry about being too loud, but you quickly encourage him to continue. You try biting your lip, but it doesn't help. He uses the same technique that now makes you thrash on the bed and moan out involuntarily despite your efforts to stay quiet to not wake Maira. Sometimes you manage to suppress all sounds for quite a while but as soon as you get close to an orgasm you cannot hold it. You've been so close so many times, but whenever you're about to cum your moaning gets too loud and he stops, turning it from pure pleasure into sweet torture.

He keeps at it for what feels like an eternity and gets so good at it he starts to only get you to the brink of moaning too loudly. You look at him with pleading eyes, not sure how long you will be able to keep going but also unwilling to end it. Finally he just puts one hand over your mouth while the other reaches over your belly around your legs, holding them in place. The sucking and simultaneous licking on your clit continues, stronger now with no intention to stop. Soon your moaning follows but now gets muffled by his big hand over your mouth, keeping you quiet enough. You reach up and grab the pillow under your head with both hands in a death grip, not letting go to keep yourself from pushing his head away. You cannot control your moaning at all anymore and if he took his hand away you would surely wake up the entire neighborhood, but it holds tightly. The stimulation is getting too much to stand and your hips start to buckle, but his strong arm holds you down while his head rides the waves of your hips without losing pressure or missing a lick. You almost go crazy with the feeling until finally with a loud growling moan your whole body convulses and you have your first orgasm in this new body, much more intense than anything you've felt in the real world for a long time. You cry out again into his hand as Olin just keeps licking and sucking your oversensitive clit throughout your orgasm, making you shake and thrash under him.

Now you try to push his head away and eventually your cries and groans slow down after he finally lets your poor clit go, licking up the fresh juices dripping out of you instead that had drenched his chin and blanket. You shudder at every touch but manage to stay quiet enough that he removes his hand from your mouth. You lie there exhausted, remembering how you struggled to get your first orgasms out in your real body when you were young and marvel at the similarity to what you had almost forgotten. You don't remember being one for moaning though, especially not uncontrollably. Filled with bliss you open your arms to invite a rather tired looking Olin into a hug, taking the opportunity to give him a quick peck on the lips, tasting some of your juices off his mouth. "Thank you, that felt really good." He pulls the blanket over you both and you turn around to let him hold you, feeling the lock keeping you safe from his dick press against your butt and his arms go around your waist with his hands cupping your breasts. "I'll definitely do something like this for you at some point." You see a blinking popup before your mental eye.

> *Know this: You have acknowledged a debt of deeds to Olin of Droan Fortress Old Tavern. Reneging on this debt will have grave consequences.*
> *Always remember, words have power.*

*Ugh, that's ... I'll have to be more careful what I say and how I phrase it.* It seems strange that the game gave you the name of the tavern but not Olin's last name. Were there rules or limits to what information you can get from system messages? You wonder if Olin had a similar popup, but when you try to ask him you notice him snoring, apparently having fallen asleep. *And he didn't even cum.* Then again he did work all day unlike you and it has gotten pretty late, but you don't feel like sleeping just yet. You consider staying in his bed for the night, comforted by the warmth of his body, but it would probably be awkward in the morning. It's not like you're a couple. Also you're worried Maira will come in to wake you up which will have dire consequences for both of you. There is another notification in your head, this one not blinking so you almost missed it.

*Congratulations! Your relationship with Olin has advanced from Neutral to Intimate.*
*He now views you as a potential life partner he can trust with intimacy.*

*Congratulations! For earning a new Intimate relationship, you have earned 1100 experience.*
*Honor thy friends and they will honor you!*

Apparently the game is not shy at spoiling relationships. At least you won't be the last person to know when you're about to get into a relationship in this world. Also this is a lot of experience compared to skill level rewards. Maybe working in the brothel isn't such a dead end after all, assuming you will get lots of intimate relationships and level up that way. Too bad it's not enough to level up.  
With a sigh you wiggle out of Olin's arms, trying not to wake him. As you move his hand he turns around but continues his sleep. You pick up the dress, snuff out the candle and briefly wondering how he managed to light it. You didn't hear him use a lighter and you're not sure they even have those here. You'll have to ask him some other time.
