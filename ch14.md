While brushing over the clothes you make plans of your own. Of the things Maira wants you to do, finishing the laundry, showering and eating breakfast are all agreeable, but then it's time to go out and explore. You have a gold coin to buy food and equipment with and you really want to check out what the shops and guild have to offer. As you keep brushing the clothes you realize that you should wash your own dress as well and since it needs to be at least mostly dry before you can go out in it again you decide to do that first. You pull it up over your head, feeling like a slave having to manually wash clothes naked. Your dress is dirtier than the other clothes, the brush removing dark lint off it, making you wonder how long it was lying around somewhere collecting dust before you got it.

After it is clean you spend extra time wringing out the dress to make it dry faster, then straighten it out. You don't have to iron the clothes but almost wish you did since that would be a way to dry the dress fast. Maybe that hasn't been invented here yet. You hang the dress near the window and get back to brushing the rest of the clothes which has something therapeutic to it. It's making you hum as you go through the pile, daydreaming of adventuring out into the plains and fighting monsters until you suddenly have the intense feeling of being watched. You pause your brushing and turn towards the door to see Olin standing there, staring at you and pushing around on the cage his member is still stuck in.

"Good morning Olin! I'm almost done" you say with a smile, feeling much more at ease with him than Maira even though you're both naked. He looked caught and embarrassed for a moment and almost retreated from the door, but now that he is not getting yelled at he stays and smiles back. "You look ... uh ... good" he stammers out. You smile and continue brushing, suddenly more aware of how your breasts jiggle with every stroke. "Your mom left for the market. There is water on the fire in the kitchen for a shower. Would you mind bringing it?" Despite concentrating on the clothes and not watching the door you keep feeling his eyes on you until you're done with that piece of clothing and grab another. A sudden emptiness fills you as the feeling disappears, making you turn back to the door to see Olin gone. You check your character sheet and find the reason for that feeling.

> Trait unlocked: Sixth Sense

**Sixth Sense**
*You can feel whenever eyes are on you. At higher level the feeling becomes more precise, also telling you how many creatures are watching you and from where.*

You don't know when or how, but somehow you had acquired a new trait. It pairs well with your Exhibitionism Skill, maybe that was a requirement, or maybe Kharn is also the god of voyeurism. Either way, you figure it might actually be useful, making you aware when your Stealth fails. You finally finish up with the laundry and can tell exactly when Olin lays eyes on you again, carrying a bucket with water and stopping in the door. "Put it on the hook" you say without looking up. He does as told and naughty ideas start filling your head. "I want to shower first. I want to get ready to go out." He keeps looking at you while you grab the same soap you used to wash the clothes. "Do you want to watch?"

You grin as he just nods, again pulling on that cage between his legs. His condition makes you sad and you think about how to fix it. There is a lock on the cage, so there must be a key, which probably is somewhere in Maira's room. Olin won't dare to search for it himself and might not even go along with you doing it, so you keep your plan to yourself. You pull on the rope of the bucket to splash yourself with warm water and then bite your lip as your thoughts wander. "Or ... how about you help me?" He swallows hard but you continue. "I feel like after having to wash your pants I should be treated like a princess, to compensate. Don't you agree?"

He gives you a weak nod and you put the soap into his hands and drag him to the middle of the room. "Of course a princess doesn't have to wash herself, she has a servant for that." You give your best impression of snobby royalty. "The princess wishes to be cleaned. Do not miss a spot or you will be severely punished." You turn your back to Olin to hide your grin and make it more exciting. "You may begin."

You wait long unnerving seconds where nothing happens, but you can feel his eyes on you thanks to your new trait. You'd feel really silly if he just left. Instead you hear squishing noises and then two soapy hands reach for your upper arms, lathering you up all the way down to your wrists. Your back is next. He starts two lanes of soap either side along your spine down from your shoulder to the small of your back. A string of soap drips lower over your butt. So far he methodically avoided touching any spot twice, giving you a new sensation every time.

After reapplying soap to his hands he reaches under your arms, making you squirm at the strange invading sensation. You try your best to stay still while his hands pass the sides of your breasts and go down lower, all the way to your hips. With the easily accessible spots gone he walks around to your front and sees your impish smile before he just grabs your breasts. He rubs the palm of his hand over your hard nipples and makes extra sure you're clean there. His hands slide down as slowly as he can manage while groping you, but all too soon his hands slide lower over your flat belly, only to reach the next interesting target.

He gulps before taking the soap again, then looks at you. "Sit on the table." You just barely put weight on the table, more leaning against it to avoid staining it. Now it's a bit too late to be convincing, but you still put on a fake annoyed look. "That's 'Please sit on the table princess' to you. I'll also accept 'your majesty'. Or maybe 'mistress'?" You wonder if you'd actually want to be called that by him, but get interrupted when he kneels in front of you. He has a great view of your privates and uses both hands on one thigh sliding down all the way to your ankles.

He repeats the process for your other leg, his finger briefly brushing your lower lips, sending quick jolts through your body. He looks up between your legs before getting up to lather his hands once more, kneels back down and takes a foot in his hand, lightly massaging it. "Hmm, that's good. Maybe you deserve a reward for your services?" He looks a bit like a caught puppy looking up at you massaging your feet. "I just might take you shopping with me. We just have to wait for my dress to dry." He looks over to it and stops his massage. After a moment of hesitation he washes the soap off his hands and walks up to the dress, touching the wet sleeves.

You're about to complain and ask why he abandoned his duties when you hear him mumble something and steam starts rising. You watch in fascination as his hands glow and dry the dress where he touches it. "Olin, that's amazing!" You think back to the candle and it suddenly makes sense. "Are you ... a fire mage?" He keeps looking at the dress, drying a few more spots before answering. "No. I do have Fire Magic, but it's low level and my Affinity is already at 0%. I only know this one spell and I can't even keep that up for long." You notice sadness in his voice. He could have been an adventurer, raining fire down on his enemies, but the system wouldn't let him. It makes you a little bitter about eventually reaching your Affinity limit as well while others will surpass you and there is nothing you can do about it.

Feeling itchy from the soap drying on your skin you go back under the bucket. "Well, thanks for drying my dress. That's still a really neat Skill. You should teach me some time. I'll finish up here. You can get your own shower water if you want." You give him an encouraging smile and turn your back to the door. Pulling the rope you pour water over yourself, promising yourself that next time you'll make him clean all the spots twice that he missed this time. Feeling his eyes on you you give him a bit of a show, sliding your hands over your butt that barely got any soap before and then between your legs. Soon you circle your clit with your fingertips, letting out soft moans.

The fact that he is watching gets you excited, especially him thinking you're not aware of it and you play with yourself way longer than is reasonable to get clean. Touching your clit feels so good now, so much better than when you first played with yourself. You decide he deserves a better look and with closed eyes you turn around, ready to cum right in front of him. To your surprise you lose the feeling of his eyes on you and opening your own reveals that he is gone. *Damn, must have scared him away.* Standing there alone playing with yourself suddenly feels silly and you use the rest of the water from the bucket to wash off your wet pussy, needing a few passes before it's no longer slick.

You wipe yourself off with a cloth that serves as a towel and put on your dress that still feels warm on your skin. Sneaking out you make sure that Olin hasn't returned, quietly push down the handle to Maira's room and slip inside. Outside you hear Olin coming up the stairs and take his shower without you. He will surely forgive you for that considering what you're about to do for him. You feel excited and afraid being where you're not supposed to be, stealing things, hoping not to get caught. Maybe being a thief would eventually cause you a heart attack.

You quickly check the drawers, trying to remember where you saw Maira put the cock cage when she brushed your hair, but the key isn't there. One of the drawers has a lot of yellowed letters. You start reading one of them.

*Dear Hayden*

*It's been 4 months since you left me. I keep hoping you'll be back, that some day you'll walk through the city gates smiling like you did that first time I saw you. I would forgive you in an instant. But I'm not stupid. I know that you turned your back on us to make your fortune elsewhere. I'm not angry or disappointed, I just wish you would come to visit. To hold me once more and to maybe acknowledge your son that is growing in ....*
"Olin?" you hear Maira's voice from below. *Shit!* You quickly put the letter back where you found it, but before you close the drawer you see a glint in the back of it. Going on instinct you reach past the letters to the back of the drawer and fish out a key. You then realize you don't actually know if this is the right one and that it would be really awkward if you told Olin you can free him from his cage and then not be able to after all, but you don't have time to think about it. You quickly hide the key in the pouch of your dress, close the drawer and exit the room, then enter your own.

A few seconds later you hear the bathroom door open and close and finally your own. "Alice, what are you doing?" You shrug "I finished with the laundry". Maira shakes her head before leaving to her own room. Your heart beats faster, fearing she will check the drawer and notice the missing key, but the rational part of your mind says she has no reason to. A minute later she comes in again. "Time to make dinner. Can you cook?" You shake your head. The cooking skills you have rely on unavailable technology and they might have spices here that you've never heard of. "Oh well, time to learn then. Come."

You bite your lip and then get up, only to hear the clinking of the key with the coin in your pouch. *Shit!* You find another pocket in your dress and move the coin over. You don't remember dresses usually having pouches or pockets in the real world, but they are really handy. Following Maira into the kitchen you decide it's time to stand up for yourself.  
"Actually I don't think I can be of use in the kitchen. You'd have to teach me everything, I only know elven food and that's very different. And ... honestly I really want to go out and explore the city." She stares at your sternly, but you hold her gaze. Finally she speaks. "Did you eat something?"
"I haven't yet, I can take some for on the ..."  
"Good" she interrupts you. "If you're unwilling to work then you don't need to eat."  
"Fine! Deal! No work no food, that's only fair" you snap at her, tired of her judging you. "I'll be going then. I'll be back in a few hours to help you with the guests."  
You turn around before she can argue and run out of the tavern.
